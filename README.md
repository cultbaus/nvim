# Nvim

Neovim configuration, assumes you are building from Nightly. At the time of writing, that is v0.10.0-dev-XXXX.

### Quick start

1. Remove or backup your current configuration

```sh
    rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
    rm -rf ~/.local/site/nvim
```

2. Clone the repo, and place in `~/.config`

That's it. That's the quick start.

### Colors

Color theme is Noctu which passes your terminal theme into Nvim. I'm using a modified version of [pap][1] to set my color theme.
